## Summary of Findings

I've been interested in finding out which stations have the most flights in San Francisco and when to take trips in terms of time, how long they last, and whether it depends on whether the user is a subscriber or a customer.

It was noticed that each type of user has preferred diffrent stations, and there is also a difference in the duration of the trips, The Customers spend longer trips than the subscribers, but both prefer the same months approximately to spend the trips in San Francisco.
